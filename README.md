# bimba
## Overview
The `bimba` package implements a variety of sampling algorithms to reduce the imbalance present in many real world data sets. Although multi-class imbalanced data sets are common, `bimba` has been designed to work only with two-class imbalanced data sets.

`bimba`'s main goal is to be **flexible** as its main use is for research purposes. In addition, as many over-sampling and under-sampling algorithms have a similar structure and several common hyperparameters, a lot of care was taken to ensure consistency between different functions, making `bimba` **intuitive** to use.

## Installation
`bimba` is under active development and not yet available on CRAN. The 
development version can be installed as follows:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("RomeroBarata/bimba")
```

## Quick Tour

```r
## Some nice setup for the graphics
library(ggplot2)
clean_theme <- theme_minimal() + theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),
                                       axis.title.y = element_blank())
                                       
## bimba in action
library(bimba)
sample_data <- generate_imbalanced_data(num_examples = 200L,
                                        imbalance_ratio = 10,
                                        noise_maj = 0,
                                        noise_min = 0.04,
                                        seed = 42)
ggplot(sample_data, aes(x = V1, y = V2, colour = target)) + 
  geom_point(size = 2) + clean_theme

# Balance the distribution of examples using SMOTE
smoted_data <- SMOTE(sample_data, perc_min = 50, k = 5)
# Sanity check. Did it really balance?
table(smoted_data$target)
ggplot(smoted_data, aes(x = V1, y = V2, colour = target)) + 
  geom_point(size = 2) + clean_theme

# SMOTE is not robust to noisy minority examples. Lets add a cleaning step 
# to the minority class before using SMOTE.
ssed_data <- sampling_sequence(sample_data, algorithms = c("NRAS", "SMOTE"))
ggplot(ssed_data, aes(x = V1, y = V2, colour = target)) + 
  geom_point(size = 2) + clean_theme

# Clean using ENN, double the size of the minority class using SMOTE, and 
# balance the distribution using RUS.
algorithms <- c("ENN", "SMOTE", "RUS")
parameters <- list(
  ENN = list(remove_class = "Minority", k = 3),
  SMOTE = list(perc_over = 100, k = 5),
  RUS = list(perc_maj = 50)
)

ssed2_data <- sampling_sequence(sample_data, algorithms = algorithms, 
                                parameters = parameters)
ggplot(ssed2_data, aes(x = V1, y = V2, colour = target)) + 
  geom_point(size = 2) + clean_theme
```

## Available Algorithms
Many over-sampling, under-sampling, and hybrid algorithms are available. In addition, the algorithms can be easily chained using the `sampling_sequence` function. A complete list of the algorithms, broken down by their type, is available below.

### Over-Sampling
- `ADASYN`: Adaptive Synthetic Sampling [7]
- `BDLSMOTE`: borderline-SMOTE1 and borderline-SMOTE2 [6]
- `MWMOTE`: Majority Weighted Minority Over-Sampling TEchnique [10]
- `ROS`: Random Over-Sampling
- `RWO`: Random Walk Over-Sampling [11]
- `SLSMOTE`: Safe-Level-SMOTE [8]
- `SMOTE`: Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling TEchnique [5]

### Under-Sampling
- `ENN`: Edited Nearest Neighbours [1]
- `KMUS`: _k_-Means Under-Sampling
- `NCL`: Neighbourhood Cleaning Rule [4]
- `OSS`: One-Sided Selection [3]
- `RUS`: Random Under-Sampling
- `SBC`: Under-Sampling Based on Clustering [9]
- `TL`: Tomek Links [2]

### Cleaning
- `NRAS`: Noise Reduction A Priori Synthetic Over-Sampling [12]

To make `NRAS` more general its cleaning step has been decoupled from the over-sampling step.

### Misc
- `sampling_sequence`: Convenience function to chain sampling algorithms 
together
