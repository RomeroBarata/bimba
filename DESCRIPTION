Title: Sampling Algorithms for Two-Class Imbalanced Data Sets
Description: Sampling algorithms to aid classifiers in learning from two-class 
    imbalanced data sets. Over-sampling, under-sampling, and hybrid 
    algorithms are included. In addition, sampling algorithms that are 
    composed of a sequence of already existing algorithms can be easily 
    created.
